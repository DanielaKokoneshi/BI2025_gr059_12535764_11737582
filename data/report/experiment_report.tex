\section{Data Understanding}
\textbf{Dataset Description:} The dataset contains U.S. colleges and universities derived from US News \& World Report.
Each row represents one institution and the columns describe selectivity, resources,
financial indicators and student outcomes such as graduation rate.

The following features were identified in the dataset:
